# Formal Languages and Compilers Project
 
### Language: C++ (Version 17)  
### OS: Windows 11  

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Formal Languages and Compilers** course at **EAFIT University**. The goal was to implement and integrate three different algorithms related to context-free grammars (CFG) and pushdown automata (PDA). The language in question is defined by the grammar:  
**S -> aSb | ab**.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three C++ files, each responsible for implementing one of the algorithms. The three components work together sequentially:

1. **Random String Generator (`ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2024_NOT.cpp`)**  
   - Generates both valid and invalid strings.
   - Valid strings are constructed based on the grammar rules.
   - Invalid strings are generated randomly without following the grammar.

2. **PDA Validator (`ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2024_NOT.cpp`)**  
   - Takes strings generated by the first algorithm and processes them.
   - Accepts or rejects strings based on the behavior of a PDA that adheres to the CFG.
   - Outputs whether each string is accepted or rejected.
3. **Sentential Form Reconstruction (`ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2024_NOT.cpp`)**  
   - Receives the valid strings accepted by the PDA.
   - Reconstructs the sentential form of each string.
   - Demonstrates the step-by-step derivation using leftmost production of the grammar.

## How to Run the Project

### Steps:
1. Only compile the third algorithm file using a C++ 17-compatible compiler.
2. Run the program from the command line or an integrated development environment.
3. The program will first generate random strings, then process them through the PDA to determine if they belong to the language, and finally, reconstruct the sentential form of those that are accepted.

### Example of Compiling and Running:
```bash
g++ ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2024_NOT.cpp -o project
./project
```

## Usage Example

1. **Random String Generation**:
   - The first component will output randomly generated strings, some of which are valid according to the CFG, while others are invalid.

2. **PDA Validation**:
   - The second component processes each string and prints whether it is accepted or rejected based on the PDAâ€™s rules.

3. **Sentential Form Reconstruction**:
   - For each accepted string, the program reconstructs the sentential form, showing how the string can be derived from the grammar.
